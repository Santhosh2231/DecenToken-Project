# DecenToken

A web app that lets you seamlessly upload NFTS to a decentralized storage called crust and gives you the ability to mint it to polygon blockchain!

## Polygon folder

To start the react server from polygon/nft-minter

```
npm start
```

## Crust folder

To start the node server from crust/

```
node index.js
```

Now you can mint your NFT and take the NFT asset link and store it in crust server.

### Things to be careful of:

- Start the servers together
- Set crust wallet and metamask wallet and balance in it
